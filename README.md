### [vad0.svg](vad0.svg)
The first logo prototype.
Literally created with a TrackPoint, while sitting in a hotel room in Boston in early 2011, and it shows.
(The terrible TrackPoint art that is.  I don't think you could deduce the Boston part from the image itself.)

### [vad1.svg](vad1.svg)
The first real attempt.
Originally drawn on a Wacom tablet, outline only.
The raptor outline was cleaned up by hand and simplified, and is more or less what you know and love today.
However, somewhere along the way I lost the path info for the bomb and was unable to simplify it, so it looks a lot worse than the raptor overall.

### [vad2000.svg](vad2000.svg)
The current generation, with all the bells, whistles, and colors.
I redid the bomb completely, with curved vectors replacing the original hand-drawn lines.
(Science!)
