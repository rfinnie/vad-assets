# Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics Assets

The first logo prototype.
Literally created with a TrackPoint, while sitting in a hotel room in Boston in early 2011, and it shows.
(The terrible TrackPoint art that is.  I don't think you could deduce the Boston part from the image itself.)

The first real attempt.
Originally drawn on a Wacom tablet, outline only.
The raptor outline was cleaned up by hand and simplified, and is more or less what you know and love today.
However, somewhere along the way I lost the path info for the bomb and was unable to simplify it, so it looks a lot worse than the raptor overall.

The current generation, with all the bells and whistles.
I redid the bomb completely, with curved vectors replacing the original hand-drawn lines.
(Science!)
There are also color fills, along with a set of hidden layers with an alternative dark theme.
